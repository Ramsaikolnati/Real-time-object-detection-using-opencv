# Real-Time Object Detection using OpenCV 🎯

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection** using **OpenCV** and deep learning models (such as MobileNet SSD or YOLO).  
It captures live video from a webcam (or video file) and detects objects in real-time with bounding boxes and labels.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time object detection using webcam or video input.
- Supports pre-trained models (MobileNet SSD, YOLO, etc.).
- Detects multiple objects simultaneously with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- Lightweight and easy to run locally.
